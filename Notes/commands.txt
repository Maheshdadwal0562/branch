suppose we make git.log file or we have some log files present in folder,we can ignore that files by making .gitignore  file which we write the file name to ignore/not shown in status , if we want to ignore all log files then type *.log in .gitignore file  and write dir/ for ignoring git directory , for outer dir write /dir/  , git don't show track folder
